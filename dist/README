Vanadium is JavaScript validation toolkit that makes client-side validation easy.
Here's a rundown of the functionality:

* Validation rules are applied to HTML elements by adding special markup classes. E.g. adding ':required' to element's classes
makes the element being validated against provided value
* It is Ajax enabled in that sence one can declare particular field being validated by the result of the server response.
E.g. adding ':ajax;/path_on_server/user_exists.json' to element's classes will cause any change to value of that element being
sent to server as request. The response is expected to be json structure in the form of:
 {success: (true/false), [message: (MESSAGE_TEXT)], [advice_id: (ID_OF_THE_HTML_ELEMENT_USED_FOR_INJECTING_THE_MESSAGE)]}


Compatible with JQuery 1.3.2
Tested in: Firefox 3.5 (PC/Mac), Safari 2 (Mac), IE 6+, Opera 9 (PC/Mac)
